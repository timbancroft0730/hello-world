# hello-world
Just getting started with GitHub. 
After doing simple scripting for windows users at the company I work for, decided to try something more challenging. As with any new adventure, the path is uncertain and destination is distant and indistinct, yet the desire to step out of my comfort zone is compelling. After all, (quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson), "Life is a journey, not a destination."
So what path am I to follow on this journey? I would like to be able to create websites, so the obvious is to learn and do with the following: HTML5 and CSS, then add Bootstrap and jQuery knowledge. From there, Javascript, and finally, ???
